<p>The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates) Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning. (Rick Cook) Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDNâ€™T be like. (pixadel) The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. (E.W. Dijkstra)</p>

<p>There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We donâ€™t believe this to be a coincidence. (Jeremy S. Anderson) Computers are getting smarter all the time. Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us. (And by â€˜theyâ€™, I mean â€˜computersâ€™. I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.) (Dave Barry) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you areâ€“by definitionâ€“not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until itâ€™s too late. (Seymour Cray)</p>
